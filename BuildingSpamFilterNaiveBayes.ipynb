    "# Building a Spam filter with Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to build a spam classifier for SMS messages that is based on the (multinomial) Naive Bayes algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to write an algorithm that is able to classify SMS messages as \"spam\" or \"not-spam\". We will train the algorithm by offering it a collection of SMS messages that have been classified by humans as spam or not-spam. After this training, the algorithm will be able to classify new messages based on what it saw before, using Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this will work in layman's terms is that during the training phase, it will be analyzed for all words that appear in a set of messages (the training set), how frequently they appear (relatively) in spam versus in not-spam messages. This information is stored in probabilities. Then, if a new (previously unknown) SMS message is offered, it applies these probabilities for the words in the new message, to calculate what is more likely: whether this message is spam, or not-spam. This will be tested on another set of messages (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through, we'll see how this works in more detail. Also, refer to the web for more detailed explanations about Naive Bayes, e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "For the process described above, we will make use of a dataset containing over 5000 SMS messages that were already classified by humans. The dataset was published in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and is described, and available for download, [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table of contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook contains the following sections:\n",
    "* Initial data exploration\n",
    "* Split into a training set and a test set\n",
    "* Training data: preparations\n",
    "* Training data: vocabulary\n",
    "* Training data: add word counts\n",
    "* Training: calculate probabilities\n",
    "* Create the spam classifier\n",
    "* Test the spam classifier\n",
    "* Conclusion and next steps"

But as far as i knew, it wasn't even up. The fact that you even felt like i would do it to hurt you shows you really don't know me at all. It was messy wednesday, but it wasn't bad. The problem i have with it is you HAVE the time to clean it, but you choose not to. You skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. You used to be good about at least making the bed.</td>\n",

It would take quite some analysis to figure out what exactly causes these to be not correct, and even more effort to figure out if there would be anything to do about it. An initial thought could be that possibly these ones were 'close' in a sense that both conditional probabilities are similar, however looking at the numbers that does not seem to be the case for most.

    "## Conclusion and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we took a dataset of around 5000 SMS messages and split it into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). Using the individual words in the messages (of the training set) and applying Naive Bayes, we built a spam classifier that was able to classify almost 99% of the messages in the test set correctly as \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Although I hadn't explicitly expressed a goal or expectation, personally I am amazed by this result!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to identify next steps, given the accuracy is so high already. One may try to figure out under which circumstances the classification goes wrong, or has a significant chance to go wrong. And then classify these messages as 'too close to call' and/or 'human judgment required'. This may prove hard though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another direction could be to look at more advanced algorithms. A potential weakness of Naive Bayes is that it assumes independece of all probabilities (that is why it is called 'naive'). In this case assuming that the probability of a word to be part of a message is unrelated to that of another word to be part of the same message. In reality, it is very likely that particular combinations of words are common, and that taking that into account could yield better results. Not having studied this though (doing that would be the first step), I expect this to be far from straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I am happy with the result though, and conclude this study!"
